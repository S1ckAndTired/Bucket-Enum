# Bucket-Enum

##### Once upon a time, found a open bucket on a VDP. I couldn't upload anything and it didn't have any sensitive info. But now, it should be easy to `map` the whole thing an try to find interesting dirs which might earn you a disclosure info.

### :man_technologist: Usage
      ./bucket-enum.sh nucket-name
